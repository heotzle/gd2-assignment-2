        After walking around and enjoying the DC atmosphere, I finally met my friends
        and we moved to a new district near Georgetown. We entered to a nice Italian restaurant
        and the interior inside was nice and it was interesting how this restaurant runs
        Italian cuisine during daytime but changes to a bar as the sun goes down.
