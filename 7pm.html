        After chilling at the coffee shop, my friends took me to the “Dungeness crabs”
        for dinner where it is famous for crabs and again, we had to take a line to eat this.
        It was quite expensive than I've thought but my friends bought it for me as a guest.
        The taste of crab was great and also the clam chowder.
