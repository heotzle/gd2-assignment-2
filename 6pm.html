        In the area of a lot of shops and restaurants are located, we entered a cafe
        for a short time where it’s called “Blue Bottle”. It looked quite familiar to me
        and I realized this brand has been introduced as America’s top 3 special coffee shop
        and the logo was cute and the interior inside was really unique to look at.
