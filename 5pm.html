      As we got hungry again, we decided to go near my friend’s house area and
      seek for the place to eat dinner. By the time we were going to my friend’s
      house side by uber, the rush hour started so I felt the traffic inside the city.
      It took 30minutes which usually takes 15minutes to get there.
